# AlgorithmVisualizations

## What Is Ths?

This project will eventually be a guide for pretty much any major algorithm I've learned, filled with interactive visualizations and extended writeups of each algorithm or data structure as I understand them. 

There are similar websites out there, but I think making something like this is a great learning activity because you have to actually program the algorithm yourself and therefore understand it a lot more and how it might be programmed in an actual language. It's also great practice with JavaScript and web development in general. 

## Timeframe

I took my first DS&A course Spring 2019, which mostly covered basic algorithmic analysis (Big O Analysis) and Graph Theory (terminology and BFS/DFS). Over the summer, I plan to add everything that I learned in that course to this repo alongside any other algorithms that I pick up over the summer (as I'll be studying pretty intensely over the summer). 

In Spring of 2020, I take my second DS&A course. This will basically just cover a whole ton more data structures and algorithms. Those will all get added, preferably during the semester as a way to learn the content. So, this website will ideally be finished by early Summer of 2020. 

## Current Focus 

I'm currently working on a visualizer for graph theory algorithms (BFS, DFS, and specialized algorithms thereof like Greedy, A*, Dijkstra, etc.). This is, for now, the only content in the repository, but won't be for long as I move to different topics. 

## Future Work

In no particular order: 

#### Specific to Graph Theory: 

- Implement BFS/DFS
- Make it so you can do BFS/DFS step-by-step instead of it all happening pretty much at once and just giving you the results at the end 
- Implement BFS/DFS tree displays (rather than just getting visit order) 
- Implement Undirected vs. Directed Graphs

#### General Website

- Work on making everything look better. I've worried a lot more about actual functionality at this point, but there's lots of room for improvement and certain site elements are cerainly an eyesore. 
- Implement more DS&A 
- Eventually turn this into a monthly subscription, one-time-fee, or put a donation link on there somewhere. I don't want to do it before the website is finished, though, so this won't happen until Summer 2020 probably.
