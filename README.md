# AlgorithmVisualizations

By the end of this project, I plan to have some sort of visualization or guide to every single algorithm or notable data structure that i encounter. 

I'm currently working on a visualizer for graph theory algorithms (BFS, DFS, and specialized algorithms thereof like Greedy, A*, Dijkstra, etc.).

This will basically complement my DS&A course and will eventually be published onto a site as a general reference guide for people who want another point of view from which to learn how certain algorithms work. 

Once I add all the algorithms I want to, I'll start to work a lot more about actual presentation and optimizing what are essentially in-depth wiki pages. Eventually, I'd like this to be a really good reference guide, because I wish I had a really good guide like this for my DS&A class. 

There could already be some similar systems out there, but I think making something like this is a great learning activity because you have to actually program the algorithm yourself and therefore understand it a lot more and how it might be programmed in an actual language. 

This'll be among the projects that I finish most of over Summer 2019, but the second part of my DS&A class is in Spring 2020, so I'll probably update it then as I learn stuff from that course. I'm doing a **ton** of work over Summmer 2019, though, so we'll see.
